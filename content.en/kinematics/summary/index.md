##Summary
- A state of rest or of motion is defined with respect to a frame of reference.
- In Physics, we conventionally follow a right handed Cartesian coordinate system to 
explain the motion of objects
- To explain linear motion the concept of point mass is used.
- A vector is a quantity which has both magnitude and direction. A scalar has only 
magnitude.
- The length of a vector is called magnitude or norm of the vector
- In a Cartesian coordinate system the unit vectors are orthogonal to each other.
- Vectors can be added using either the triangular law of addition or the parallelogram 
law of addition.
- Any vector can be resolved into three components with respect to a Cartesian 
coordinate system
- The magnitude or norm of a vector q is the a ngle between A and B   is given by 
A = A A

A Az = + + 2 2 2
- If two vectors are equal, then their corresponding individual components should be 
separately equal.
- The position vector of a particle with respect to a Cartesian coordinate system is 
given by ˆ ˆ ˆ r x  i yj z  k 
- The scalar product of two vectors is defined by   A B. c = AB osθ (q is the a ngle between A and B  
q is the a ngle between A and B  
)
- The vector product of two vectors is defined by A  B A  B n sin ˆ   . The direction of

 can be found using right hand thumb rule or right hand cork screw rule.
- In physics, scalar and vector products are used to describe various concepts.
- Distance is the total path length travelled by the particle and displacement is the 
difference between final and initial positions. Distance is a scalar quantity and 
displacement is a vector
- Average velocity is defined as  

- For constant acceleration, kinematic equations can be used to analyse motion of a 
particle.
- In projectile motion for which acceleration is uniform, the path traced by the particle 
is a parabola. 
- The maximum height and range of the particle in projectile motion depend inversely 
on acceleration due to gravity g.
- The angular displacement of the particle is defined by θ = s

 and angular velocity

- The relation between the linear velocity and angular velocity is given by    v r = × ω
- The centripetal acceleration is given by a

directed towards the centre of the circle.
