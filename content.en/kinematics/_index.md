**Learning Objectives**

**In this unit, the student is exposed to** 
- different types of motions (linear, rotational and oscillatory)
-  the necessity for reference frames to explain the motion of objects
-  the meaning of vectors, scalars and their properties 
-  the role of scalar and vector products in physics 
-  the basics of differentiation and integration 
-  the notions of displacement and distance and their variation with time 
-  the notions of speed, velocity, acceleration and their graphs.
-  the notion of relative velocity 
-  kinematic equations of motion for constant acceleration 
-  analysis of various types of motion of objects under gravitational force
-  radians and degrees 
-  uniform circular motion, centripetal acceleration and centripetal force.
